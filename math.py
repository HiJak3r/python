# You can subtract integers
print(50 - 50)

# You can multiply integers
print(50 * 50)

# You can divide intigers - This will also create what's called a float which is simply a decimal even if it's only 1.0
print(50 / 50)

# Python will automagically do PEMDAS for you
print(50 + 50 - 50 * 50 / 50)

# If you want an exponent you can use this
print(50 ** 2)

# The % sign is called a modulo - this simply gives you what is left over aka the remainder
print(50 % 6)

# This will give allow you to divide with the remainder
print(50 / 6)

# If you want no remainder, you can do this
print(50 // 6)
